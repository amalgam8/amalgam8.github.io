This demo starts two versions of a helloworld microservice each with two
versions, in order to demonstrate how Amalgam8 can be used to split
incoming traffic between the two versions. You can define the proportion of
traffic to each microservice as a percentage.

## Deploy and Scale the App

The commands to deploy the helloworld demo application for different
environments are as follows:

_Docker Compose_

1. Bring up the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f examples/docker-helloworld.yaml up -d
   ```

1. Scale the individual versions as follows:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f examples/docker-helloworld.yaml scale helloworld-v1=2
   docker-compose -f examples/docker-helloworld.yaml scale helloworld-v2=2
   ```

1. Set the gateway environment variable:

   ```bash
   export GATEWAY_HOST_PORT=localhost:31200
   ```

   **Note:** If you are using Docker Toolbox on the Mac, use
   `$(docker-machine ip default):31200` instead of
   `localhost:31200`

_Kubernetes_ on localhost or on Google Cloud

1. Bring up the containers:
   ```bash
   kubectl create -f examples/k8s-helloworld.yaml
   ```

   The above command automatically launches two instances of each version of
   `helloworld`.

1. Set the gateway environment variable:

   ```bash
   export GATEWAY_HOST_PORT=$(minikube ip):31200
   ```

_IBM Bluemix_

1. Create Bluemix routes (DNS names) for the registry, controller and the helloworld app's gateway:  

   ```bash
   bluemix cf create-route <your bluemix space> mybluemix.net -n <your helloworld route>
   ```

1. Specify the route name in the _examples/bluemix.cfg_ in the HELLOWORLD_HOSTNAME variable.

1. Deploy the helloworld application on bluemix.

   ```bash
   examples/a8-bluemix create helloworld
   ```

   The above command automatically launches two instances of each version
   of `helloworld`.

   Verify that the services are running using the following commands: 

   ```bash
   bluemix ic groups
   ```

1. Set the gateway environment variable:

```bash
export GATEWAY_HOST_PORT=helloworld.mybluemix.net
```

### List the Services in the App

You can view the microservices that are running using the following command:

```bash
a8ctl service-list
```
    
The expected output is the following:

```bash
+------------+--------------+
| Service    | Instances    |
+------------+--------------+
| helloworld | v1(2), v2(2) |
+------------+--------------+
```

There are 4 instances of the helloworld service. Two are instances of
version "v1" and the other two belong to version "v2".

## Version-based routing

1. Lets send all traffic to the v1 version of helloworld. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   a8ctl route-set helloworld --default v1
   ```

1. We can confirm the routes are set by running the following command:

   ```bash
   a8ctl route-list
   ```

   You should see the following output:

   ```bash
   +------------+-----------------+-------------------+
   | Service    | Default Version | Version Selectors |
   +------------+-----------------+-------------------+
   | helloworld | v1              |                   |
   +------------+-----------------+-------------------+
   ```

1. Confirm that all traffic is being directed to the v1 instance, by running the following cURL command multiple times:

   ```bash
   curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   ```

   You can see that the traffic is continually routed between the v1 instances only, in a random fashion:

   ```bash
   $ curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   Hello version: v1, container: helloworld-v1-p8909
   $ curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   Hello version: v1, container: helloworld-v1-qwpex
   $ curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   Hello version: v1, container: helloworld-v1-p8909
   $ curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   Hello version: v1, container: helloworld-v1-qwpex
   ...
   ```

1. Next, we will split traffic between helloworld v1 and v2

   Run the following command to send 25% of the traffic to helloworld v2, leaving the rest (75%) on v1:
    
   ```bash
   a8ctl route-set helloworld --default v1 --selector 'v2(weight=0.25)'
   ```

1. Run this cURL command several times:

   ```bash
   curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   ```

   You will see alternating responses from all 4 helloworld instances, where approximately 1 out of every 4 (25%) responses
   will be from a "v2" instances, and the other responses from the "v1" instances:

   ```bash
   $ curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   Hello version: v1, container: helloworld-v1-p8909
   $ curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   Hello version: v1, container: helloworld-v1-qwpex
   $ curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   Hello version: v2, container: helloworld-v2-ggkvd
   $ curl http://$GATEWAY_HOST_PORT/helloworld/hello
   Hello version: v1, container: helloworld-v1-p8909
   ...
   ```

   Note: if you use a browser instead of cURL to access the service and continually refresh the page, 
   it will always return the same version (v1 or v2), because a cookie is set to maintain version affinity.
   However, the browser still alternates in a random manner between instances of the specific version.

## Cleanup

To remove the `helloworld` application,

_Docker Compose_
  
```bash
docker-compose -f examples/docker-helloworld.yaml kill
```

_Kubernetes_ on localhost or on Google Cloud

```bash
kubectl delete -f examples/k8s-helloworld.yaml
```

_IBM Bluemix_

```bash
examples/a8-bluemix destroy helloworld
```
