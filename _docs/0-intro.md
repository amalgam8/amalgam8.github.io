Before describing Amalgam8, it is important to understand two key concepts
that are essential to any
[microservice application](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html),
namely content and version-based routing.

## Content and version-based routing - 101

In any realistic production deployment, there are typically multiple
versions of microservices running at the same time, as you might be testing
out a new version, troubleshooting an old version, or simply keeping the
old version around just in case.

*Content-based routing* allows you to route requests between microservices
based on the content of the request, such as the URL, HTTP headers,
etc. For example,

```
from microservice A, if request has "X-User-Id: QA", route to instance of
(B:v2) else route to instance of (B:v1)
```

*Version-based routing* allows you to control how different versions of
microservices can talk to each other. For example,

```
from microservice A:v2 route all requests to B:v2
from microservice A:v1 route 10% of requests to B:v2 and 90% to B:v1
```

A simple way to accomplish these functions is to control how
microservices can talk to each other.

## Amalgam8

Amalgam8 is a platform for building polyglot microservice applications that
enables you to route requests between microservices in a *content-based*
and *version-based* manner, independent of the underlying container
orchestration layer
([Docker Swarm](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-swarm),
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io),
[Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/)) or the cloud platform
(Amazon AWS, IBM Bluemix, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, etc.

**[Amalgam8 Sidecar](/docs/sidecar.html):** Amalgam8 uses the sidecar model or
the ambassador pattern for building microservices applications. The sidecar
runs as an independent process and takes care of service registration,
discovery and request routing to various microservices. The sidecar model
simplifies development of polyglot applications.

**[Amalgam8 Control Plane](/docs/control-plane.html):** The microservice runtime
management layer, called the Amalgam8 Control Plane, can be used to
dynamically program the sidecars in each microservice and control how
requests are routed between microservices. It consists of a [Route
Controller](/docs/control-plane-controller.html) and a [Service Registry](/docs/control-plane-registry.html).

The following diagram illustrates how these components work together:

![how it works](/docs/figures/how-amalgam8-works.svg)

1. Microservice instances are registered in the service registry by the
   sidecars. There are several ways this may be accomplished as described in
   [Amalgam8 Registry](/docs/control-plane-registry.html).

2. The Developer uses the control plane API to configure high-level rules
   for request routing between services (e.g., splitting traffic across
   versions, injecting delays).

3. The route controller translates these rules into low-level control information
   and sends them to the sidecars.

4. A microservice invokes APIs of other microservices by pointing to the
   sidecar as the destination host. The API endpoint is of the following
   format:

   ```
   http://localhost:6379/serviceName/apiEndpoint
   ```

5. The sidecar (which is based on Nginx/OpenResty) forwards the request to the
   appropriate microservice, depending on the request path and routing
   rules specified by the controller.


The control plane provides REST
APIs that serve as the basis for building tools for various DevOps tasks
such as [A/B testing](https://www.optimizely.com/ab-testing/), internal
releases and dark launches,
[canary releases](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html),
red/black deployments,
[resilience testing](https://developer.ibm.com/open/2016/06/06/systematically-resilience-testing-of-microservices-with-gremlin/),
etc.
