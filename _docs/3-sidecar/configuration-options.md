The following instructions apply to both Docker-based and Kubernetes-based
installations. Configuration options can be set via environment variables,
command line flags, or YAML configuration files.  *Order of precedence is
command line flags first, then environment variables, configuration files,
and lastly default values.*

To run the sidecar with a configuration file, use the following command:

```bash
a8sidecar -config /path/to/a8sidecar.yaml
```

## Options Reference

environment variable name, the command line switch and the field in the
YAML file.

## Example configurations

* [Service registration](#service-registration)
* [Health checks](#health-checks)
* [Request routing](#request-routing)
* [Process supervision](#process-supervision)

### Service registration <a id="service-registration"></a>

Registration and heartbeat with the Amalgam8 service registry 
can be enabled by setting the following environment variables or 
setting the equivalent fields in the config file:

```bash
A8_SERVICE=service_name:service_version_tag
A8_ENDPOINT_PORT=port_where_service_is_listening
A8_ENDPOINT_TYPE=http|https|tcp|udp|user
A8_REGISTER=true
A8_REGISTRY_URL=http://a8registryURL
```

Equivalent YAML config:

```yaml
#a8sidecar.yaml
service:
  name: service_name
  tags: 
    - service_version_tag
    - some_other_tag
  
endpoint:
  port: port_where_service_is_listening
  type: (http|https|tcp|udp|user)

register: true
registry:
  url:   http://registry:8080
```

  
### Health checks <a id="health-checks"></a>

In addition to automatic service registration,
the sidecar can periodically check the health of the application at specified 
HTTP endpoints. _When the application fails to respond or returns an error, 
the sidecar will immediately unregister the service instance from the 
Amalgam8 registry._

Health checks can configured using environment variable in the following manner:

```bash
A8_HEALTHCHECKS=http://localhost:8080/health1,http://localhost:9090/health2
```

Alternatively, a more expressive and customizable health check can be configured
in the YAML configuration file:

```yaml
healthchecks:
  - type: http
    value: http://localhost:8080/health1
    interval: 15s
    timeout: 5s
    code: 200
  - type: http
    value: http://localhost:9090/health2
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 3s
    code: 201
```

where
* `type` indicates the type of health check. Currently only http health checks are supported.
* `value` indicates the health check URL.
* `interval` indicates the frequency of the health check. Time intervals can be suffixed with `s`, `m` to indicate seconds or minutes.
* `timeout` indicates how long the sidecar will wait for the application to respond to the health check API call.
* `code` indicates the HTTP response code that the sidecar should expect from the application.

Note that the sidecar will access the specified URL via the GET method only.


### Request routing <a id="request-routing"></a>

For microservices that make outbound calls
to other microservices, service discovery and client-side load balancing,
version and content-based routing can be enabled by the following options:

```bash
A8_SERVICE=service_name:service_version_tag
A8_PROXY=true
A8_REGISTRY_URL=http://a8registryURL
A8_REGISTRY_POLL=5s
A8_CONTROLLER_URL=http://a8controllerURL
A8_CONTROLLER_POLL=5s
```

Equivalent YAML config:

```yaml
service:
  name: service_name
  tags: 
    - service_version_tag
    - some_other_tag

proxy: true

registry:
  url:   http://registry:8080
  poll:  5s
  
controller:
  url:   http://controller:8080
  poll:  5s
```

If you want to enable both request routing and registration, add the
following to the above config:

```bash
A8_REGISTER=true
```

or in YAML:

```yaml
register: true
```

### A complete configuration file

The following is an example config file for a sidecar that supervises a python application called `helloworld.py`, monitors its health and registers it with the service registry, while proxying requests to other services.

```yaml
register: true
registry:
  url:   http://registry:8080
  poll:  5s

proxy: true
controller:
  url:   http://controller:8080
  poll:  30s
 
##Setting up app supervision
supervise: true
app: [ "python", "helloworld.py ]

healthchecks:
  - type: http
    value: http://localhost:8080/health1
    interval: 15s
    timeout: 5s
    code: 200
  - type: http
    value: http://localhost:9090/health2
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 3s
    code: 201
```

### Process supervision <a id="process-supervision"></a>

Sidecar can start and supervise any number of application processes. If one of the applications dies,
supervisor can be configured to terminate the sidecar process as well. 

All arguments provided after the flags will be considered a part of a single application
invocation.  By default, the sidecar process will exit if this application terminates. The following
`ENTRYPOINT` can be placed in a Dockerfile to start the sidecar process as well as one python application:

```bash
ENTRYPOINT ["a8sidecar", "python", "myapp.py"]
```

More advanced supervision modes can be configured by providing a yaml config.  For instance, if you
wanted to run filebeat and a python application, the following yaml could be provided:

```yaml
commands:
  - cmd: [ "filebeat", "-c", "/etc/filebeat.yml" ]
    env: [ "GODEBUG=netdns=go" ]
    on_exit: ignore
  - cmd: [ "python", "productpage.py", "9080", "http://localhost:6379" ]
    on_exit: terminate
```

where
* `cmd` indicates the commands you want to run.
* `env` indicates any additional environment variables the application may need to run with.
* `on_exit` can have the values `ignore` or `terminate` which indicates what the sidecar 
process should do if this application terminates.
